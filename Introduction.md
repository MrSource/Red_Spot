>	The project’s name is Red Spot. Now the questions are, what is Red Spot and why is the app called like that? It’s very simple, Red Spot is a social network application that is going to change our day, this app will allow you to check-in in many different places where you would like to share with others (friends, family, co-workers and other). This app has the versatility of giving you the experience of being in a place without really being there. We give this name to the app because each time that you visit a place and would like to share your experience, pictures or any other thing like feedback you can turn on your GSP or put the location enable at your computer and the app will automatically put a ping on the map in order that others can view your photos and feedback and if they would like to go they can see exactly at the map where is that located. The name of the team who is developing this app is call the null terminators. This app will make a lot of things not just the one that has been described but the main idea is that one. The application will also allow people to add other friends, places or even better, create an event with your friends to visit one of the places.

>	The way to feedback places will be easy. You can feedback rating the places from 1 to 5 stars, also you can write what was your experience. The rating by stars will be divided in different categories, the categories will be place, service, environment and other depending on the place. For example, if the place that you visited is a restaurant you will be able to rate that restaurant by service, quality of the food, environment and our app will make some specific calculations for the overall starts of the place. To ensure the best experience with this application the teams decided to show in every post of the people who are using this app the timestamp because it will let the others see how that specific place was in a specific time.

>	Null Terminators Choosed this host to work with because it is a robust one and we want a good service for all the spotters who are the one that are going to be using this application via this host. Also we decided to use JQuery, PHP and AJAX because this all three are powerfull tools to develop what is going to be Red_Spot.

>The team will be using Slack as a working bench, also the project manager will be using Gantt charts to show his team visually how are they working, in what percentage of the project they are and also what are the deadlines of the project task.
