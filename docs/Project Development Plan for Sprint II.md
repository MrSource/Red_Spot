Project Development Plan for Sprint II
======================================

### Sprint II:

For sprint II we are going to develop the following:

* Login Landpage: Page that loads after a user logs in to RedSpots. This aims to be the profile of the user.
* Search: Allows users to search a spot, a category or other spotters. This feature will use sugestions as the users types.
* Add spotters: Users can add other spotters which may be friends, relatives or coworkers.

Additionally, the Master Project Plan and the Gantt Chart will be updated accordingly to what we accomplish during the sprint.
