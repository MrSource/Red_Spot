### 2.	General Description

 2.1	**Product perspective:**
 <p>
RedSpots is an independent web application, linking to other social applications like Instagram and Facebook is not supported. 
</p>
 2.2	**System Evolution:**
 <p>
The life cycle used is the traditional Introduction-Growth-Maturity-Decline cycle. During the introduction, documentation and models will be presented. In the growth stage, the design and implementation of the features will be developed. During maturity, any other further implementation of the features is done as well as maintenance and bug fixes. Lastly, in the decline stage the maintenance will be less frequent.
</p>
 2.3	**Product Functions:**
 <p>
The essential functions of the product will be:
* 	User accounts to use the features of the social network.
* 	Relatives, friends and co-workers can be added as spotters.
* 	The app will display categories for different types of spots.
* 	Users can upload images, share, rate and review when visiting a spot.
* 	Locate the spot.
* 	Live feed where users can see the posts of their spotters.
</p>
 2.4	**Users of the product:**
 <p>
RedSpots is aimed to users that have the capabilities and opportunities to visit spots they are interested in. These users can be from young adults to elderly that have basic knowledge of the main components of social networks.
</p>
 2.5	**General Constraints:**
 <p>
Constraints for this product are mostly software wise. The main concern is that the application must access the device image gallery to upload pictures since RedSpots will not have authorization to access the camera of the device. Mobile devices must access the application from the browser of the device. 
</p>
 2.6	**Assumptions and dependencies:**
 <p>
Assuming that most or all of the essential features are developed in time, we can work on other desirables features, such as reporting misguided information on a post.
